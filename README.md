### Creation of remote-repo
 Some work done inside `ather` brannch
- To simply create a branch we will use command `git branch branchName`
- Then if we want to switch to that branch we will use the command `git checkout branchName`
- But if you want to create and switch to one branch in one command you can use `git checkout -b branchName`
- How to delete a branch `git branch -d branchName` `This work is done in secondBranch`
- The branches have the copy of the work from main / or other branch from where it was created. But they will have no idea if the main or their parent branch is update. 'work done in thirdBranch'
- Work done in child of Main branch
- Work done by grandChildOfMain
- How to check whith remote repo your repository is connected?
    `git remote -v`
- How to add a remote repo to a local repo?
    `git remote add origin thelinkofremoterepo`
- How to disconnect / remove the connection to remote repo from a local repo?
    `git remote remove origin`
